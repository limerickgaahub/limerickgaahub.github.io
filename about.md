Limerick GAA Hub is designed to provide a clear and intuitive overview of fixtures and results — easily filterable by competition, team, or date. Over time, the aim is to build an archive of historical results.

Please note, this site is not associated with Limerick GAA — I am solely a club member sharing resources.
